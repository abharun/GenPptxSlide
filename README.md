# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Purpose

When you try to fetch image with functiton, CORS policy issue occurs, even you can see from browser or can set as source of `img` tag.
So you can get the data by using module `modern-screenshot`, convert img tag into data.
